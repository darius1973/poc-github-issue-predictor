# GitHub Issue Resolution Predictor

This project is a **Spring Boot + Smile** machine learning proof of concept that predicts whether a GitHub issue will be resolved quickly (within 7 days) or not, based on live issue data.

It uses:

* **Spring Boot** for REST APIs
* **Smile ML library** for logistic regression
* **WebClient** to fetch data from the GitHub API
* **Java 17**
* Public repository: [`spring-projects/spring-boot`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) (as training data source)

## üß† How It Works

* At startup, the app **trains a logistic regression model** using:

  * 20 issues closed within 7 days
  * 20 issues not closed quickly
* For prediction, you provide an **issue number**.
* The app fetches the issue, extracts features (e.g., title length, comments, labels), and uses the model to predict:

  * `"Resolved quickly"` or
  * `"May take longer"`

## üîß Configuration

In `application.properties`:

```properties
github.token=ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX   # GitHub API token (required for rate limits)
github.repo=spring-projects/spring-boot    # Format: owner/repository
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

```bash
mvn clean install
java -jar target/github-issue-predictor-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## üîç API Endpoints

### Predict Resolution Time

```http
GET /api/predict/{issueNumber}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "result": "Resolved quickly"
}
```

## üí° Example Use Case

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/predict/45800
```

## üß™ Model Features

The logistic regression model is trained using:

* Issue title length
* Number of comments in the first 24 hours
* Presence of code blocks in the description
* Whether the user is a project collaborator
* Number of labels

## üöÄ Future Improvements

* Use more sophisticated models (e.g., neural networks)
* Include additional features like issue type, linked PRs, etc.
* Train on a larger, more balanced dataset
* Provide a web UI for predictions
